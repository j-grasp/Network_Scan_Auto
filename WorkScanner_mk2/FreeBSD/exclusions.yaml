# =============================================================
# EXCLUSIONS — Hosts that must NEVER be scanned under any
# circumstances. This file is validated at startup AND

#
# For OT/ICS segments, be exhaustive. When in doubt, exclude.
# A missed vulnerability finding is recoverable.
# A crashed PLC or medical device is not.

  - ip: 10.30.0.10
    label: "Siemens S7-1200 PLC — Assembly Line 1"
    reason: "Will fault under port scan. Physical consequences possible."

  - ip: 10.30.0.11
    label: "Siemens S7-1200 PLC — Assembly Line 2"
    reason: "Will fault under port scan. Physical consequences possible."

  - ip: 10.30.0.20
    label: "SCADA HMI — Production Floor"
    reason: "Vendor states scanning will cause process interruption."

  - range: 10.30.0.50/30
    label: "Flow controllers — Building Utilities"
    reason: "Legacy firmware crashes on SYN packets."

  # ── Building Management ─────────────────────────────────────
  - ip: 192.168.1.5
    label: "Building Management System"
    reason: "Fragile — vendor prohibits network scanning."

  - ip: 192.168.1.6
    label: "HVAC Controller"
    reason: "Known to become unresponsive under scan load."

  # ── Medical / Safety-Critical ───────────────────────────────
  - range: 172.16.5.100/30
    label: "Medical IoT Devices"
    reason: "Safety-critical. Scanning prohibited by compliance policy."

  # ── Infrastructure — scan separately if needed ──────────────
  - ip: 192.168.1.1
    label: "Core Router"
    reason: "Managed separately. Scanning may affect routing tables."

  - ip: 10.10.0.1
    label: "DMZ Firewall"
    reason: "Managed separately by network team."

# ── Exclusion validation behavior ──────────────────────────────
# 'strict' = abort entire segment scan if exclusion list
#            cannot be loaded or parsed. Recommended for OT segments.
# 'warn'   = log warning and continue (for non-OT segments).
